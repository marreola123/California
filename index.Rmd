Hello, Website!

For more information about simple R Markdown websites, please read the documentation at https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html.

Please also note that simple R Markdown sites are _not_ based on **blogdown**. They are probably good for websites with only a few Rmd documents. For larger-scale and more sophisticated websites (such as blogs), you may want to use **blogdown** instead: https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown.
